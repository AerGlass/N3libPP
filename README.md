#N3Lib++

a N3Lib fork that eventually grows as more stuff gets added.<br>
features:<br>
fully updated to work on latest libnds/devkitarm.<br>
<h1> What is N3lib</h1></p>
a random library 3d library made by knightfox75.<br>
<h1> why did you called this n3lib++ instead of PA3D</h1></p>
I think that it does not have way too much features to rename it.</p>
<h1>Updates?</h1></p>
<strong>Don't expect new features, this is just updates for future libnds versions</strong> I think N3lib features are already enought
I will add new features if i need it or they are requested (Please, no 3d model support, it is way too much for my brain).
